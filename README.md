I used csv files for creating the database. I have 500 random turkish names and random 500 turkish surnames. 
The code is combining them for creating a real name without duplicates. Firstly, you should run the sql file in phpmyadmin, it will create
tables after that if you run start.php file it will make all insert operations. Then with mainmenu.php file you can see all informations.
